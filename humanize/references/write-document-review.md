# Document review (long-form / whitepaper) and privacy

## Review dimensions (pick as needed)

1. **Privacy and compliance**
   - Identity, contact, **precise address**, undisclosed salary, internal codenames, unreleased products.
   - Signals of **job hunting**, **competitor secrets**, unauthorized customer stories → flag; suggest delete or anonymize.
2. **Tone consistency**: formal/colloquial jumps, AI tells returning (see `write-zh.md` / `write-en.md`).
3. **Bilingual**: semantic and term alignment per `write-bilingual.md`.
4. **Readiness**: `TODO`, `[TBD]`, `Lorem`, placeholders, broken links/anchors.

## Output (matches parent SKILL)

- **Full polish requested**: default **revised body only**.
- **Review comments requested**: annotation list OK; if body also changed, body first unless user wants notes separately.
- Optional footer: `privacy: clear` or `privacy: N issues found` (omit if not asked).

## Paragraph coherence (diagnose only, no full rewrite)

In document order:

1. **Turns**: topic jumps without signal.
2. **Carry-over**: section opening ties to previous closing.
3. **Pace**: all short or all long sentences in one block.

Each item: **location (§ or quote first few chars) + minimal fix** (word swap, reorder, one bridge sentence). End by asking if the user wants a **full rewrite**.

## Do not

- Over-formalize deliberate colloquial voice unless audience requires it.
- **Repeat** sensitive PII in the report (say «paragraph N may contain PII»).

## Technical accuracy (research-write drafts)

For JVM/API deep-dives after **research-write**, use **`research-write/references/review-checklist.md`** (version wording, sources, code safety). For de-AI + layered scan, use **`write-qa-layers.md`** (L1–L4). This file stays **privacy + coherence**; those references stay **tells + technical publish gate**.
