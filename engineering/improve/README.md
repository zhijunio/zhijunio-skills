# improve

An agent skill that audits any codebase and writes implementation plans for other agents to execute.

The idea: use your most capable model for the part where intelligence compounds — understanding the codebase, judging what's worth doing, writing the spec — and hand execution to cheaper models. The skill never implements anything itself. The plan is the product.

```
you          →  /improve                    (expensive model, advises)
plans/       →  001-fix-n-plus-one.md       (self-contained specs)
other agent  →  implements, tests, ships    (cheap model, executes)
```

## Install

```bash
npx skills add shadcn/improve
```

Works in any agent that supports [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format. The plans it writes are plain markdown, so any agent (or human) can pick them up.

## Usage

```
/improve                        full audit → prioritized findings → plans
/improve quick                  cheap pass: hotspots, top findings only
/improve deep                   exhaustive: every package, every category
/improve security               focused audit (also: perf, tests, bugs, ...)
/improve branch                 audit only what the current branch changes
/improve next                   feature suggestions — where to take the project
/improve plan <description>     skip the audit, spec one thing
/improve review-plan <file>     critique and tighten an existing plan
/improve execute <plan>         dispatch a cheaper executor, review its work
/improve reconcile              refresh the backlog: verify, unblock, retire
/improve ... --issues           also publish plans as GitHub issues
```

## How to use

A typical first run, start to finish:

1. Open your agent in the repo and run `/improve` (or `/improve quick` to keep it cheap).
2. It maps the repo, audits it, and comes back with a findings table. Reply with the ones you want planned — "plan 1, 3 and 5".
3. Plans land in `plans/` — one file each, plus an index with the recommended order. Read them; they're meant to be reviewed.
4. Hand a plan to any agent ("implement plans/001-*.md"), or let the skill run it: `/improve execute 001`. It dispatches a cheaper model in an isolated worktree, reviews the diff against the plan, and reports back with a verdict. Merging stays up to you.
5. Next session, run `/improve reconcile` to clean up the backlog: verify what landed, refresh what drifted, unblock what got stuck.

Before a PR, `/improve branch` does the same thing scoped to just what your branch changes.

## Example

A run against [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) came back with findings like:

```
| # | Finding                                        | Category  | Effort | Confidence |
|---|------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | shadow-config duplicated in search.ts/view.ts, | tech-debt | M      | HIGH       |
|   | copies already drifted (TODO at search.ts:31)  |           |        |            |
| 2 | O(n²) icon migration (migrate-icons.ts:168)    | perf      | S      | HIGH       |
```

…and rejected a few, with reasons recorded so they don't come back next run:

```
- [SEC-01] https_proxy env var "SSRF": by-design — standard proxy convention,
  every CLI honors it. Not a finding.
```

Picking #1 produced [this plan](./examples/001-extract-shadow-config-resolution.md) — current code excerpted, exact steps, the repo's own test/lint commands as verification gates, and STOP conditions for when reality doesn't match.

## How it works

**Recon.** Maps the repo: stack, conventions, and the exact build/test/lint commands — these become verification gates in every plan.

**Audit.** Fans out parallel subagents across nine categories: correctness, security, performance, test coverage, tech debt, dependencies & migrations, DX, docs, and direction (feature suggestions — every one must cite evidence from the repo itself, no generic idea-slop). Every finding carries `file:line` evidence, impact, effort, and confidence.

**Vet.** Subagents over-report, so the advisor re-reads every cited location itself before showing you anything — false positives get dropped, wrong attributions get corrected, rejections get recorded.

**Prioritize.** Findings land in a table ordered by leverage (impact ÷ effort, weighted by confidence). You pick what becomes plans.

**Plan.** One file per selected finding, written into `plans/` with an index, priority order, and dependency graph.

## What makes the plans executable

Plans are written for the weakest plausible executor — a model that has never seen the advisor session and may be much smaller. Three properties carry that:

- **Self-contained.** All context is inlined: exact file paths, current-state code excerpts, repo conventions with an exemplar file, verified commands. No "as discussed above."
- **Verification gates.** Every step ends with a command and its expected output. Done criteria are machine-checkable. The executor never has to judge whether it succeeded.
- **Hard boundaries.** Explicit out-of-scope lists, and STOP conditions — "if X, stop and report" — instead of letting a small model improvise when reality doesn't match the plan.

Each plan also stamps the git commit it was written against, so executors run a mechanical drift check before touching anything.

## Closing the loop

Plans aren't fire-and-forget:

- **`execute <plan>`** spawns a cheaper executor subagent in an isolated git worktree, hands it the plan, then reviews the result like a tech lead — re-runs every done criterion, checks scope compliance, reads the diff against intent. Verdict: approve (merging stays your call), send back for revision (max 2 rounds), or block and refine the plan.
- **`reconcile`** processes what happened since: verifies DONE plans still hold, investigates BLOCKED ones and rewrites around the obstacle, refreshes drifted plans, retires findings that got fixed independently.
- **`--issues`** publishes plans as GitHub issues — same self-contained body, so any agent or human can pick them up where work already lives.

## Hard rules

- Never modifies source code itself. The only writes go to `plans/`; executors edit only in disposable worktrees, and merging is always yours.
- Never runs commands that mutate your working tree — read, search, and read-only analysis only.
- Never reproduces secret values. Locations and credential types only, rotation always recommended.
- Asked to implement? It declines and points at the plan (or offers `execute`).
