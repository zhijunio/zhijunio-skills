# zhijunio-skills

**Agent Skills** for **Cursor** and similar AI coding assistants: one directory per skill, with **`SKILL.md`** as the entry (`name` / `description` in YAML for discovery). Some skills add **`references/`** playbooks and **`scripts/`** for reproducible runs.

## Skills

| Directory | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| [**bookmark**](bookmark/SKILL.md) | Save links as local Markdown bookmarks (title, tags, dedup). |
| [**diary**](diary/SKILL.md) | Diary files: paths, timestamps, images, `DIARY_VAULT_ROOT`, Git flow. |
| [**jinrishici**](jinrishici/SKILL.md) | Today’s poem API; fixed Chinese display format. |
| [**keep**](keep/SKILL.md) | Sync Keep runs to Garmin-style `running.json` (`keep/scripts/`). |
| [**research-write**](research-write/SKILL.md) | Multi-source → long-form; `research-write/references/` + `drafts/<slug>/` layout. |
| [**fetch-content**](fetch-content/SKILL.md) | URL / PDF → Markdown; `fetch-content/references/` — decision tree, CN platforms, MCP, **research-write** handoff. |
| [**humanize**](humanize/SKILL.md) | De-AI polish; `write-zh.md` / `write-en.md` replacement tables; **L1–L4** `write-qa-layers.md` (optional 质检报告). |
| [**rewrite-article**](rewrite-article/SKILL.md) | Split by headings, DAG reorder, section rewrite; see `rewrite-article/references/` for DAG examples and **humanize** handoff. |
| [**grill-me**](grill-me/SKILL.md) | One question at a time on a plan/design, with recommended answers, until the decision tree aligns. |
| [**handoff**](handoff/SKILL.md) | Compress the session to a handoff doc (temp file + path refs) for the next agent. |

## Optional chains

```text
fetch-content → research-write (research pipeline) → humanize (de-AI)
                    ↘                      ↗
                 rewrite-article (reorder) ──┘

grill-me (stress-test plan) ──→ research-write / sdd-plan (user switches to persist)
handoff (new session) ──→ points at fetch-content / research-write / humanize / rewrite-article, etc.
```

- **research-write** Phase 1: **fetch-content** + `research-sources.md`; file under `research-write/drafts/<slug>/`.
- **research-write** Phase 5–6: **humanize**; structure → **rewrite-article** first; review → `research-write/references/review-checklist.md`.
- **grill-me** / **handoff** are outside SDD increment contracts; app repos use installed `sdd-plan`, etc.

## Usage

1. Add this repo to your host’s **Skills** config so each `SKILL.md` is indexed.
2. Skills usually trigger from **`description`** match; you can also name a skill in the prompt.
3. Scripted skills (**fetch-content**, **keep**) document commands in `SKILL.md`; install deps (`bash`, `python3`, `requests`, …) on the machine.

## Layout

```text
<skill>/
  SKILL.md           # entry: name, description, boundaries
  references/        # optional playbooks
  scripts/           # optional shell / Python
```

## Maintenance

- Root **`renovate.json`** for dependency update proposals when Renovate is enabled.
